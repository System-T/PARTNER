PARTNER: Deep Entity Name Understanding with Human-in-the-loop

---

Demo paper published in AAAI-20. PARTNER is a human-in-the-loop deep learning system for entity structure understanding. It learns a `light` deep BiLSTM-CRF model for entity structure parsing. We are also integrating BERT with PARTNER to leverage state-of-the-art pretrained models. 

We are going through an internal process to open source the tool. Once it's approved, the code will be available in this repo.
